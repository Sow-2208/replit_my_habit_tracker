Create a modern, clean, student-friendly Habit Tracker Website.

Main Goal:
The website should help me track my daily habits, visualize my progress, and stay motivated throughout the year — all in ONE dashboard/sheet.

Core Requirements:

1. Habit Section (Daily Tasks)
- Allow me to create a list of daily habits (example: Wake up early, Study 2 hours, Exercise, Coding practice, Reading, No phone distraction, etc.)
- Each habit should have a checkbox for every date.
- When a checkbox is ticked, it should be saved automatically.
- Habits should be editable (add, delete, rename).

2. Calendar View (Yearly + Monthly)
- Show all 12 months of the year.
- Inside each month, display all dates clearly (1–31 depending on the month).
- Each date should reflect completion status (color-coded: green = completed, yellow = partial, red = missed).
- Clicking a date should show which habits were completed that day.

3. Progress Graphs
- A line or bar graph that shows:
  - Daily habit completion percentage
  - Weekly progress
  - Monthly progress
- Graph should update automatically when checkboxes are ticked.
- Include a yearly consistency graph (streak-based).

4. Flowchart / Progress Journey
- Add a visual flowchart that represents my journey:
  Start → Building Habits → Staying Consistent → Improving Skills → Achieving Goals
- Flowchart should update visually based on progress (locked/unlocked stages).
- Each stage should show motivational messages when reached.

5. Motivation Section
- A dedicated section where I can:
  - Add my own motivational quotes
  - Add short personal reasons (e.g., “I want a good career”, “I want to be disciplined”)
- Show a random motivation message daily.
- Display a motivational message when I complete all habits for the day.

6. Streak & Consistency Tracker (Important)
- Show:
  - Current streak
  - Longest streak
- Highlight streak milestones (7 days, 30 days, 100 days).
- Gentle reminder if a streak is about to break.

7. All-in-One Dashboard
- Everything should be visible in ONE scrollable page:
  - Habits
  - Calendar
  - Graphs
  - Flowchart
  - Motivation
- Clean UI, minimal colors, student productivity theme.
- Mobile and desktop responsive design.

8. Extra Features (Add these if possible)
- Dark mode / Light mode
- Export progress as PDF or CSV
- Monthly reflection notes section
- Simple login or local storage so data is not lost

Tech Preferences (optional):
- Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if advanced)
- Use Chart.js or similar for graphs
- Use LocalStorage or database to save progress

Overall Feel:
- Minimal
- Motivational
- Discipline-focused
- Easy to use daily
